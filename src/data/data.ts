    "Black usually doesn't do well in the late game, rather, it finds innovative ways to get superior positions early on so that it can rule in the midgame. Often, this means you will sacrifice life for cards for an early advantage. Card advantage plays a very big role, though at the loss of life. It can play very well by itself through corruption effects and work with other colors all equally well. Reanimation decks have always been a favorite, finding ways to dump big, expensive creatures into the graveyard early and then play them from there for cheap. Animate Dead and Zombify both work well for this. Black is also known for it's discard effects.",

    "Alone, white is commonly known as an aggressive color. Packed with effective cards such as Savannah Lions, Knight of the Holy Nimbus, and Isamaru, Hound of Konda, white can quickly outnumber the opponent with too many threats to handle, and by the time he can handle it, he's already lost. Combined with another color, white is well-suited to play the role of a supporter to whatever role the other color wishes to play. It is commonly known to be effective at controlling the game with blue. For black, they have a tendency to share in life gain. Red is more than happy to adopt the cheap, effective creatures white holds to get even more aggressive, though this makes it more crucial to get both colors of mana very quickly (say from Battlefield Forge).",
