  " Black usually doesn't do well in the late game, rather, it finds innovative ways to get superior positions early on so that it can rule in the midgame. Often, this means you will sacrifice life for cards for an early advantage. Card advantage plays a very big role, though at the loss of life. It can play very well by itself through corruption effects and work with other colors all equally well. Reanimation decks have always been a favorite, finding ways to dump big, expensive creatures into the graveyard early and then play them from there for cheap. Animate Dead and Zombify both work well for this. Black is also known for it's discard effects.",
  'Black is one of the five colors of mana in Magic. It is drawn from the power of swamps and embodies the principles of parasitism and amorality (though not necessarily immorality). The mana symbol for Black is represented by a skull. On the color pie, it is the ally of blue and red, and the enemy of white and green. Black seeks power through ruthlessness or opportunity.',
